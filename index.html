                             However, it is not always easy to find qualified and experienced professionals. Unfortunately,
                             many developers deliver too few applications, which can lead to frustration for
                             customers. By some estimates, around 60% of developers deliver less
                             of 5 applications and only 20% deliver between 5 and 9. Therefore, it is important to choose a
                             software development company with a dedicated and experienced team to ensure
                             your projects to be successful.
